## Introduction

<a href="https://orchid.software/" target="blank">Laravel Orchid</a> has provided a unique experience for writing applications. Still, sometimes a simple CRUD needs to be done when it might seem overkill. Therefore, we have created a new package aimed at developers who want to quickly create a user interface for eloquent models with functions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting.


You can describe the entire process using one file. And when you need more options, it's easy to switch to using the platform.
All fields, filters, and traits are compatible.


## Official Documentation

Documentation for CRUD can be found on the [orchid.software](https://orchid.software/en/docs/packages/crud/#introduction) website.


## Roadmap

This roadmap isn't meant to cover everything we're going to work on. We will continue to invest in making CRUD easier to use and easier to manage.
We want to do:
- [x] Add setting for displaying and restoring deleted models with `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes`;
- [x] Add the ability to perform actions for multiple models;
- [ ] Support of nested relations when viewing  

It is an active community, so expect more contributions that will complement it with all sorts of other improvements to help improve production.
